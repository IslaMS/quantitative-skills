## 1. Evaluate your quantitative skills
Today over 50 of us have gathered for the University of Edinburgh Practical approaches to Assessment in the Sciences symposium. We come from many different disciplines, including:

 - Ecology
 - Environmental science

 
 
 #### We asked ourselves: 
 
 #### How quantitative do you think you are relative to your peers? 
 
We all closed our eyes (except the one person counting) and voted on a scale of 0 to 10. Five means you are equivalent to your peers. Zero means you feel way behind and you think you have no quantitative skills. Ten means you think you'll win the Field medal next year, because your quantitative skills are oustanding.

So what did we find? We quickly put the data together and made this graph of the results:

You can find the data from our speed survey in the GitHub repository for this tutorial. Here is the code we used to create our graph:

```r
ggplot(results, aes(score)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_classic()
```

## 2. Learn about Coding Club

Coding Club aims to create a supportive peer-to-peer community to advance quantitative skills among scientists at all career stages. We combine in-person workshops with online tutorials (https://ourcodingclub.github.io/) to promote statistical and programming fluency in the programming language R. We want to combat statistics anxiety and code fear to facilitate career progression and life-long learning. Coding Club workshops are free and open to all and represent a judgement-free opportunity for people to acquire a skill set tailored to their scientific needs.

## 3. Re-evaluate your quantitative skills

__Can thinking about quantitative training change your perception of your own quantitative skills?__

We closed our eyes once more and re-evaluated our skills. What did we find?

Here is the code for our updated graph:

```r
ggplot(results, aes(score, fill = test, colour = test)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_classic()
```

This tutorial has taught us aboutâ€¦ 

In our group discussion, we came up with these five ideas to teach quantitative skills in innovative ways:

1.
2.
3.
4.
